FaceBook Messenger Bot with Ruby & Sinatra

This chatbot returns the GPS coordinates of a country, city/town or address.
You can message the [CoBot FaceBook page here](https://www.facebook.com/CoBot-439436693082135). 
However it's hosted on a free Heroku server which sleeps and the message isnâ€™t sent until it wakes. 
So you will probably recieve a very delayed response. It works well on local server though.
